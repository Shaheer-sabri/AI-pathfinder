# AI-pathfinder
A PathFinder AI for that will implement different algorithms and a GUI to lead the user to the shortest path to a destination. The use of different algorithms is to display the efficiency of each one for the said problem. The algorithms used are ACO( Ant Colony Optimization ), Yenâ€™s k shortest path and A* search algorithm.

A GUI is implemented for interactive input and output. After running the code, a 20*20 grid appears. Tap on the blocks to make them unwalkable i.e. the pathfinder should not be able to traverse those blocks. Enter the starting point in the first empty bar in the format x, y where x is the x coordinate and y is the y coordinate. Enter the destination point in the same format in the second empty bar. Click one of the three buttons to find a path using that algorithm. A path from source to destination would appear on the grid. The reset button clears thee grid(makes all points walkable) and removes any previous path printed on the grid.

A* Algorithm: The A* algorithm employs sets to maintain the open set and closed set, keeping track of visited nodes during the search. Using the Manhattan distance, the algorithm calculates heuristic scores (h_score) for each node. It then selects the node with the lowest f_score (sum of g_score and h_score) as the current node. By exploring the neighbors of the current node, updating their scores and parent pointers, the algorithm continues until either the goal node is reached or there are no more unexplored nodes remaining.

ACO Alorithm:In a given map, several ants are initially placed on a starting node. Each ant selects its next node based on a probability formula, considering the concentration of pheromone left by previous ants. As they traverse the path, ants leave pheromone marks, both while going from one node to another and on the return journey. The ant that completes the shortest path returns first, resulting in a higher concentration of pheromone on that specific route. Subsequently, when another ant chooses its next node, it is more likely to be attracted to the path with a higher pheromone concentration. Over time, this process of marking and following pheromone trails causes the ants to converge towards a single shortest path, as the strongest pheromone trail indicates the most efficient route.
ALPHA = 1
Beta = 1


Yen's K Shortest Paths Alorithm: Utilize the A* search algorithm to determine a path from a given source node to a destination node. Save this path in a list. Then, remove one edge from the path and repeat this process K times. Keep track of all the stored paths. Finally, on a graphical user interface (GUI) grid, display the best path among all the stored paths.
